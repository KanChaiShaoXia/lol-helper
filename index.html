      content="Welcome to the League of Legends Summoner Spell Cooldown Tracker! This software is designed to help League of Legends players keep track of cooldown timers for champion abilities. As a tool for summoners, it allows you to manually enter spell casts to start a countdown timer for each skill.
    
    With our tracker, you can conveniently see the remaining cooldown duration of your own and enemy abilities. This allows you to make informed decisions on when to engage or retreat in lane and teamfights. Unlike trying to memorize all the cooldowns, our tool reduces the mental burden so you can focus more on gameplay.
    
    To use it, simply click on the icon of a champion spell after it is cast in your match. The tracker will start counting down from the full cooldown duration. You'll then have a clear visual indicator of when that spell will be available again. While not fully automated, our LoL Summoner Spell Cooldown Tracker is an easy-to-use aide that helps summoners improve their gameplay awareness and decision making. Try it out today to step up your League of Legends skills!"
